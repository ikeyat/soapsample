@WebService(
        endpointInterface="com.example.app.soapserver.endpoint.sample.SampleServiceEndpoint",
        wsdlLocation="/META-INF/wsdl/SampleService.wsdl"
)
public class SampleServiceEndpointStub implements SampleServiceEndpoint {
    public ResponseMessage execute(RequestMessage arg0) {
        // begin dummy code

        // end dummy code
    }

}
```
